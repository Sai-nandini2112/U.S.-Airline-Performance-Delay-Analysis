# U.S.-Airline-Performance-Delay-Analysis

This project analyzes U.S. domestic airline flight data to uncover patterns in delays, cancellations, and operational performance. It utilizes **SQLite** for data processing and **Tableau** for interactive dashboard development, ultimately delivering actionable insights for stakeholders such as airlines and airport authorities.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Understand cancellation and delay trends across U.S. flights
- Identify best and worst-performing airlines and airports
- Build an interactive dashboard to support data exploration
- Deliver data-driven recommendations for operational improvement

## 📊 Key KPIs Analyzed

- Total Flights
- On-Time Performance Rate (OTP ≤ 15 mins delay)
- Average Arrival Delay (in minutes)
- Cancellation Rate (%)
- Delay Causes Distribution

## 📈 Dashboard Highlights (Tableau)

- **Overview Page**: High-level KPIs and trends
- **Airline Performance**: Bar charts and tables comparing airline OTP, delays, and cancellations
- **Airport Performance**: Average delays by airport and geographic map of hotspots
- **Temporal Trends**: Delay patterns by day of week and time
- **Filters**: By airline, airport, date, and delay type for interactive analysis

## 📌 Key Findings

- Average arrival delay: **58.49 minutes**
- On-Time Performance Rate: **29.85%**
- Cancellation Rate: **16%**
- **American Eagle**: Highest delays & cancellations
- **Atlantic Southeast Airlines**: Best on-time performance
- **Wilmington Airport**: Longest average delay
- **Saturday**: Worst-performing day for delays

---

## ✅ Recommendations

1. **Airline Operations**: Improve scheduling and crew management at underperforming airlines.
2. **Airport Efficiency**: Investigate delays at high-delay airports like Wilmington and Roswell.
3. **Weekend Planning**: Reinforce resources on weekends when delays peak.
